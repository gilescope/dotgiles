## nix dotfiles

I'm a new nixos user so possibly not the best to crib from except I'm mad enough to be using a mac.

I'm running a MacBookPro14,3 - 15" with touchbar. The last to have a T1 chip in.

## TODO

I remapped esc to caps for now.

Not everything is sorted _yet_. Here's the todo list with tips:

 * Sound - seems possible though only at full volume: https://github.com/davidjo/snd_hda_macbookpro
 * Touchbar (Function keys) - https://github.com/roadrunner2/macbook12-spi-driver.git

## Other nix dotfiles examples

If you want to see some other examples, I've made a collection of them here: https://github.com/gilescope/nix-all
